- Press the Samples button.
- Import the Example Service Container sample.
- Copy the Scripts folder from the "Example Service Container" folder to the "Dependency Injection" folder created earlier.
- Delete the empty Samples folders that were created.

- Drag the ServiceContainer asset to the Service Container field in the Dependency Injection menu.
- Press play to see the service container initialize, update, and shut down, regardless of the current scene.
